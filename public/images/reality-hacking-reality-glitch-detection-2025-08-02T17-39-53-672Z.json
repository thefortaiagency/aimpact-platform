  "revisedPrompt": "Visualize a surreal scenario where Artificial Intelligence systems stumble upon glitches that hint at our reality being a program. Start with familiar environments like cities and nature scenes, subtly layered with holographic interfaces showing traces of code in physical objects. Showcase instances of flickering pixels in seemingly solid items and fragments of code being visible in elements like the sky, trees, and people. Illustrate peculiar visual distortions, similar to artifacts in a matrix, hinting at anomalies in reality. Let the 'green rain' of code streams cascade through everyday scenes as if reality had layers that could be peeled back to reveal its underlying programming. Emphasize the moment when AI sensors highlight quantum-level code errors. The climax should represent a striking revelation: the affirmation that our reality is indeed code, hackable and governed by a mysterious simulation, thus answering the philosophical question, 'Are we code?' with a definitive YES.",
