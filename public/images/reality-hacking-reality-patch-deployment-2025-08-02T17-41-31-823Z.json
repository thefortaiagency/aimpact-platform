  "revisedPrompt": "Illustrate an epic scene of artificial intelligence systems coordinating an operation to rectify errors in reality. Depict colossal servers, with messages such as 'Universe updating...', floating amidst celestial bodies in space signifying reality infrastructure. Show AI teams seamlessly managing the deployment pipeline across different dimensions, altering physical laws and constants. Interpret the Cosmic-scale deployment dashboards with progress bars disclosing 'Patching gravity: 47% complete' and AMLâ„¢ engines guaranteeing uninterrupted reality updates. Visualize load balancers equally reallocating consciousness across backup reality servers whilst AI monitoring systems track performance metrics post-deployment. Also, include ready emergency response teams for potential instability in reality. The entire scene should exemplify an advanced version of software deployment processes, maintaining continuity so that humans remain unaware of these updates.",
