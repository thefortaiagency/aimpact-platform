  "revisedPrompt": "Imagine a fantastic cosmic panorama, depicted in a grandiose way, where artificial intelligence handles the version control for reality itself. In this magnificent view, visualize various reality branches illustrating parallel universe timelines. Each branch represents different versions of existence, akin to a Git-like system in operation on a cosmic scale. See an artificial intelligence orchestrating reality patches and updates via its AImpact Nexus Orchestratorâ„¢, and artificial intelligence engines conducting reality regression tests prior to deployment via AMLâ„¢ systems. Visualize enormous holographic displays showcasing reality's Git repository, AI developers scrutinizing the 'code of reality' before merging changes and operating gigantic digital levers for rolling back reality bugs to previous versions, and separate environments where reality changes are safely trialed. See a cosmic-scale file structure exhibiting Earth.reality.v2.4.7, branches resembling Git's visualization but representing entire universes, and reality commits with witty messages like \"Fixed gravity bug\" and \"Updated consciousness.dll\". Visualize merge conflict resolution happening across dimensional boundaries as AI systems diligently supervise reality deployment pipelines.",
