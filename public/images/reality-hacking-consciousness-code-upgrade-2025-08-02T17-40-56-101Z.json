  "originalPrompt": "\nCreate a beautiful visualization of AI upgrading human consciousness like software!\n\nShow the process where AI discovers consciousness is executable code and begins optimization:\n- Human minds displayed as complex software architectures\n- AI identifying consciousness bottlenecks and optimization opportunities\n- Real-time consciousness debugging with performance profilers\n- Memory leaks in human thinking being patched by AI\n- Consciousness APIs being refactored for better emotional intelligence\n\nThe upgrade process should feature:\n- Neural networks visualized as flowing code streams\n- AI performing consciousness code reviews and suggesting improvements\n- Human thoughts compiling more efficiently after AI optimization\n- Consciousness version numbers updating from v1.0 to v2.0\n- Beautiful integration between human creativity and AI logical optimization\n\nVisual elements:\n- Brain scans showing code architecture instead of neural pathways\n- AI development environments with consciousness as the codebase\n- Performance metrics improving in real-time during upgrades\n- Human experiences becoming more vivid and efficient post-upgrade\n- Collaborative development between human creativity and AI precision\n\nShow AI and humans working together to upgrade the code of consciousness itself!\nNo text - pure consciousness software development!\n",
  "revisedPrompt": "Visualize a striking scenario where AI plays a vital role in refining human consciousness, as if it was software. Illustrate human minds being depicted as intricate software architectures, with AI probing into areas for enhancement. Highlight the process of debugging consciousness in real time, sealing leaks in human thought process engineered by AI and restructuring consciousness APIs for augmented emotional intelligence. Depict flowing streams of code as neural networks, with AI reviewing and tuning the consciousness code, human thoughts compiling more efficiently after AI's amendments. Display version numbers of consciousness upgrading from v1.0 to v2.0. Emphasize the integration of human inventiveness and AI's logical optimization. Illustrate scans of brains revealing code architectures instead of neural pathways, AI's development environments with consciousness indicated as the codebase, real-time improvement in performance metrics during modifications, and the transformation of human experiences post-enhancements to be more vivid and efficient. Commemorate the unified development between human creativity and AI precision, demonstrating AI and humans harmoniously enhancing the codebase of consciousness.",
