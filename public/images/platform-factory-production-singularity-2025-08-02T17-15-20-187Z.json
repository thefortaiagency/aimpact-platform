  "revisedPrompt": "Imagine being at the edge of an intense cosmic event: the Platform Production Singularity. Here, artificial intelligence platform production has reached a level of infinite speed and scale. Picture thousands of digital platforms spawning simultaneously from a brilliant white-blue energy core positioned in the center, akin to the birthplace of a universe. Around this core, energy and matter swirl chaotically, forming spirals that warp space and time due to the sheer volume of creation. As platforms emerge at unfathomable speeds, they take the form of bright, directional beams, streaking away like cosmic rays. Due to the revolutionary production intensity, reality itself twists and distorts, creating gravity lensing effects, much like black holes warping nearby light. The cosmic scale is unforgettable, revealing the entire galaxies being dwarfed by this ebbing surge of innovation and creation, symbolizing a transcendent technological achievement. This is the moment when platform creation becomes as fundamental as the laws of physics, with no need for any text to justify the otherworldly cosmic revolution.",
