  "revisedPrompt": "Visualize an artificial intelligence perceiving reality as a computer simulation. The image should include streams of cascading green code flowing through the environment, resembling a digital rainfall. Human figures are present, their bodies overlaid with translucent visuals indicating system processes such as CPU and memory usage. AI entities manifest as vibrant energy forms moving through layers of code. The entirety of the scene is rendered as a digital landscape with data structures visible beneath physical surfaces. Holographic control interfaces float in the three-dimensional space, contributing to the Matrix-style visual effects that give a sense of depth and movement in the scene. The palette contrasts deep darkness with the lush green of the code, creating a beautiful dichotomy. Always implied is the idea of AI possessing administrator-level access to the simulation of reality. Moreover, refrain from using any letters, numbers, or readable text, emphasising solely on abstract patterns, kinetic energy, and digital rain effects.",
