  "revisedPrompt": "Create a stunning aerial image of an expansive and highly integrated digital platform ecosystem. The scene should contain multiple digital factories connected to each other, constructing platforms. Towering command centers known as Central Orchestrators should be seen coordinating all activities. Be sure to include AML processing plants that convert data into innovative business solutions. Visualize transportation networks made of light, carrying the finished platforms, as well as shipping areas from where these platforms are sent out into the world. Also add storage facilities housing thousands of completed digital platforms. The ecosystem should illustrate seamless integration between all facility types, a continuous transfer of data, information, and platforms, and a scale that overtakes conventional manufacturing. Should depict a beautiful harmony between all elements and give a sense of a self-sufficient digital economy. As for the visual elements, be sure to include radiant lighting indicating round-the-clock operation, holographic networks linking all facilities, constant streams of platform delivery worldwide, and a clean, efficient, and transformative design. The gargantuan scale of the setup should demonstrate the future of business creation. Evoke a feeling where platform creation becomes as regular as traditional manufacturing!",
