  "revisedPrompt": "Visualize a cosmic scene where planets function as massive thought nodes, or cosmic neurons. Each planet should be glowing with energy implying neural activity. These glowing planets should be connected with each other through orbital patterns that resemble complex synaptic networks. The energy flowing between these planets indicates thought processing. Observe the planetary surfaces featuring ever-changing neural activity patterns. The moons of each planet act as neural satellites or supporting networks to the main 'planetary brain'. The entire scene should represent a beautiful and vast cosmic neural processing system at the scale of a solar system. Avoid including any text within the scene.",
