  "originalPrompt": "\nCreate a stunning neural network consciousness visualization featuring the EXACT AImpact Nexus logo design.\n\nThe AImpact Nexus logo should be:\n- A flowing, organic \"A\" shape made of curved, liquid-like lines\n- Beautiful gradient from cyan/turquoise at the left to deep purple/magenta on the right\n- Three main flowing strokes that form the \"A\":\n  1. Left stroke: flowing upward curve with organic, wave-like quality\n  2. Right stroke: straight diagonal line from top-right to bottom-right\n  3. Center crossbar: elegant horizontal connection with a small dot/node\n- Circular endpoints on each stroke (like connection nodes)\n- Smooth, liquid appearance - NOT angular or geometric\n- Natural, biological feeling curves rather than sharp edges\n\nThe neural network should:\n- Emanate from the logo's circular connection points\n- Flow along the logo's organic curves\n- Extend outward with data streams and neural pathways\n- Feature consciousness layers as translucent fields\n- Show pulsing nodes representing AI processing centers\n- Create depth with multiple layers of neural activity\n\nVisual style:\n- Deep space black background\n- Cyan-to-purple gradient matching the logo\n- Holographic glowing effects\n- Organic, flowing data streams (not angular lightning)\n- Smooth gradients and soft edges throughout\n- Revolutionary tech aesthetic with biological inspiration\n\nThe feeling: \"This is consciousness technology that flows like life itself - organic AI that enhances humanity.\"\n",
  "revisedPrompt": "Generate an image representing a stunning visualization of a neural network consciousness. The central focus of the image should be an organic, fluid, 'A'-styled logo which transitions from a cyan/turquoise gradient on the left to a deep purple/magenta on the right. It should comprise three main strokes: An upward curving left stroke with a waveform quality, a top-right to bottom-right straight diagonal right stroke, and an elegant horizontal connection with a small node in the center. The endpoints of each stroke are circular, adding to the liquidity of the design. From these points, likeness of a neural network unfolds, tracing the organic curves and extending outward through data streams and neural pathways. Several layers of translucent consciousness fields are present, pulsing nodes are visible demonstrating AI processing centers and a depth effect is achieved through the layers of neural activities. The background is a deep space black color, while the colors of the neural network match the logo's cyan to purple gradient. The overall effect should feel like an organic take on AI, a revolutionary tech aesthetic inspired by biological forms, with a life-like fluidity suggesting advancements in consciousness technology.",
