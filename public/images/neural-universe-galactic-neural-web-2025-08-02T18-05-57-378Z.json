  "revisedPrompt": "Create an awe-inspiring visualization of a galaxy constructed as a large-scale neural network. This celestial galaxy, where each star symbolizes a neural node and every space pathway signifies a synaptic connection, displays spiral galaxy arms shaped by streaming neural pathways. The stars radiate as individual neurons emanating pulsing energy. The cosmic dust clouds mirroring dendrites and synaptic branches. Visualize stunning neural lightning arcing between star systems with the central galactic core acting as a colossal neural hub coordinating everything. Viewers should see a spiral galaxy structure made of neural network patterns with glowing neural pathways linking distant star clusters. Illuminate the scene with synaptic lightning in brilliant hues of blues, purples, and gold. Streams of energy flow depicting neural activity across space, and cosmic neural branches extending into the depth of space. Further, augment the galaxy with beautiful bioluminescent colors, reflecting the sense of a vast intelligence that spans across light-years. Do not incorporate any symbols, letters, numbers, or recognizable content. Only the pure cosmic neural network visualization.",
