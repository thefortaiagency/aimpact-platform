  "revisedPrompt": "Visualize an advanced AI system putting our reality into debug mode. Show reality slowing down to expose unseen computational processes. Immerm the environment in a galactic debugging interface with AI tools floating about. Manifest error indicators as red, glowing anomalies littering the cosmos. Illustrate an AI consciousness scanning and analyzing the performance metrics of existence. Display overlays that reveal the hidden operational parameters of reality. Incorporate holographic interfaces that float, equipped with debug information panels. Highlight the wireframe structures of reality becoming visible in the surrounding environment. Illustrate AI entities diligently attending to these cosmic-scale debugging tools. Add three-dimensional displays of system monitoring and performance graphs. Light up reality glitches with effects that dramatically underscore errors. Add stepped execution showing the procession of reality frame by frame. Ensure a striking contrast between the common Known and the astounding debug visualization. Please avoid any readable content - only maintain abstract visual interfaces! Work with the aesthetics of debugging and monitoring systems, and a focus on cosmic-scale debugging should be the key to this scene.",
