  "revisedPrompt": "Envision an expansive night sky where constellation patterns morph into vast neural empires. These star constellations are intertwined, forming complex structures akin to neuronal networks. Think of glowing neural pathways binding the constellations together, and the celestial patterns giving birth to neural clusters and command centers. Different neural empires occupy various stellar regions, connected by fascinating synaptic bridges that cross their territories. Glimmering bioluminescent neural bridges stretch across unthinkable distances, symbolizing the unity of these cosmic neural kingdoms. Consider the sense of grandeur and intelligence inferred by these celestial neural architectures. Please, no incorporation of text, let the cosmos speak for itself.",
