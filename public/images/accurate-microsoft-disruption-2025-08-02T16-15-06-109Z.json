  "originalPrompt": "\nCreate a powerful visualization of technological disruption where the EXACT AImpact Nexus logo transforms the industry.\n\nThe AImpact Nexus logo design:\n- Flowing, organic \"A\" shape with liquid-like curves\n- Cyan-to-purple gradient flowing from left to right\n- Three elegant strokes:\n  1. Left: graceful upward curve with natural wave quality\n  2. Right: diagonal stroke from top-right to bottom-right\n  3. Center: horizontal crossbar with connection node\n- Circular endpoints suggesting connection and flow\n- Smooth, biological appearance - like flowing water or energy\n- Natural curves that feel alive and growing\n\nThe disruption scene:\n- Fragments of outdated technology dissolving in space\n- The flowing \"A\" logo emanating healing energy beams\n- Broken structures reforming into organic, flowing architectures\n- Old rigid systems transforming into flexible, life-like networks\n- Light rays from the logo that reconstruct rather than destroy\n- Transformation showing evolution from rigid to flowing\n\nVisual elements:\n- Deep space background with transformation in progress\n- Cyan-to-purple gradient colors throughout the scene\n- Contrast between old (gray, fragmented) and new (flowing, colorful)\n- Organic reconstruction patterns following the logo's curves\n- Sense of gentle revolution - evolution rather than destruction\n\nShow the moment when AImpact Nexus doesn't just disrupt - it heals and evolves the digital world into something more human.\n",
  "revisedPrompt": "Visualize a scene representing technological disruption and evolution. At the center, a logo with a flowing, organic 'A' shape, composed of liquid-like curves with cyan-to-purple gradient flowing from left to right, is set. The logo has three elegant strokes: left stroke has a graceful upward curve with natural wave quality; right stroke is diagonal from top right to bottom right; center stroke is a horizontal crossbar with a connection node. The endpoints are circular, indicating connection and flow. The logo exhibits a smooth, biological appearance, similar to flowing water or energy. The scene around consists of fragments of outdated technology dissolving, the flowing 'A' logo emanating healing energy beams that reform broken structures into organic, flowing architectures. Old rigid systems transform into flexible, life-like networks due to the light rays from the logo. The deep space background showcases the shift from gray, fragmented old systems to new, flowing, colorful structures. The transformation is gentle and evolutionary, just like a brand embodying revolution, healing and evolving the digital world into something more human.",
