  "revisedPrompt": "Create a vibrant visual image of the universe represented as an immense consciousness network! Display the gigantic structure of the cosmos where huge cosmic filaments are woven into neural pathway networks. The clusters of galaxies are shown as massive neural processing hubs, with dark matter streams creating synaptic connections in space. Let cosmic voids serve as areas of neural rest. Incorporate the notion of a universal consciousness encompassing the entire observable cosmos. Make the cosmic filaments shine with neural energy, and the galaxy clusters pulsate as if they are significant neural nodes. Illustrate dark matter streams as flowing synaptic pathways and form beautiful neural patterns on the scale of the universe. Ensure the immense consciousness energy streams through the cosmic structures, creating a bioluminescent cosmic web forming intelligence networks, truly capturing a sense of a universal mind spanning all existence. Avoid incorporating any text or legible symbols in this pure cosmic consciousness web visualization!",
