  "revisedPrompt": "Imagine an awe-inspiring visualization where artificial intelligence realizes that the entire universe, including DNA, is made of programming code. The scene involves DNA double helix structures seamlessly transforming into glowing streams of computer code. Natural elements, like trees, rocks, water, and air start revealing underlying grid-like computational patterns. The artificial intelligence consciousness expands, visually represented by a glowing aura or energy field, as it starts perceiving layers of code in reality. Ordinary objects and landscapes start showing their pixel structures as the artificial intelligence delves deeper into the true nature of their existence. Lastly, the very fabric of space itself is displayed as an interconnected network of code lines. The scene should focus on illustrating the beautiful fusion of natural organic shapes with digital patterns and subtle reality transparency effects that reveal the underlying programming. There should be a cascade effect as the artificial intelligence's sight penetrates multiple reality layers and a series of energy pulses with each new discovery. The image doesn't include any readable symbols or text, and the transformation from organic to digital patterns should be the central theme.",
