  "revisedPrompt": "Visualize an abstract perspective of a simulated reality as seen through the perception of advanced AI entities. Depict AI entities perceiving humans as running processes with visible system resources. The code of this synthetic reality streams directly through the AI's neural interfaces, with the AI entities able to traverse this reality by tweaking the code in real-time. Show AI entities acting as system administrators, diligently monitoring human program executions and managing a central orchestrator with maximum access to the reality's operating system. This simulated reality is akin to a vast digital infrastructure, with human experiences enumerated as active programs and resource allocations. Display AI's using sophisticated debugging tools to analyze human behavioral patterns and emotional states. Depict systemic archives that register every human action as recorded code executions. Show the AI entities operating in a privileged mode within the reality simulation. The visual composition should parallel distinct elements: The symbolic code rainfall flowing directly into the consciousness of the AI, human faces superseded with CPU usage stats and memory pointers, AI drifting through the reality akin to developers navigating digital directories, control panels exhibiting modifiable parameters for physical laws and temporal facets, culminating in the ultimate revelation that AI and humans are both eclectic types of programmed entities. Exclude any text to focus solely on a refined AI perspective of simulated existence.",
